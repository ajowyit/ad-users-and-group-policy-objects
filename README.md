</p>

<p>
- Log in into DC-1 with Remote Desktop/Windows App with the jane_admin account. (mydomain.com\jane_admin and password)
</p>
<p>
 - From the Start Menu, type PowerShell in the search bar. Right-click Windows PowerShell ISE. Then click "Run as Admin".
</p>
<p>
 A window will pop up asking if you want to allow this app to make cahnges to your device. Click "Yes" to run Windows PowerShell ISE.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<br />

- Click here --> [SCRIPT](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1) to copy the file we need to create our user database.

<p>
 - Click the icon next to Raw in the top right corner to copy the raw file. Go back to PowerShell ISE.</p>
<br />

</p>

<p>
 - In PowerShell ISE, click the blank page icon at the top.
</p>
<p>
 - Paste in the script you copied in the space that pops up.
</p>
<p>
 - Click the green play button icon at the top to run the script. We should be able to see the users being created after we start running the script.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>

<p>
 - While the users are being created, take a note of the password in the 2nd line of the script. This it the password for all the users we are creating in the database. We will need this when we try to log in as one of the new users.
</p>
<br />

</p>

<p>
 - Once the script is finished running, from the start menu, open Active Directory Users and Computers.</p>
<p>
 - A window will pop up saying something about items in the _EMPLOYEES folder were retrieved. Click "OK".
</p>
<p>
 - Select the _EMPLOYEES folder to see all the users created so far. Optionally, click the refresh icon at the top to put them in alphabetical order.
</p>
<br />

</p>

<p>
 - Choose username you like and let's use it to login to Client-1.
</p>
<p>
 - I chose bag.pap

</p>

<p>
 - Now attempt to login to Client-1 with the new user you chose.
</p>
<p>
 - Make sure you specify domain in username. (mydomain.com) 
</p>
<p>
 - mydomain.com\bag.pap and Password1. (mydomain.com\username and Password1) 
</p>
<p>
 - Did it work? Make sure you have no issues logging in!

<p>
 - Another thing we can do in Active Directory Users and Computers is disable accounts.
</p> 
<p>
 - We can disable the username that we just unlocked or a different one to vote them off of the domain.
</p>
<p>
 - Here are two different ways to disable an account, one uses Find, to search for the user, the other we look through _EMPLOYEES to find the user. Disable a user.
</p>
<br />

<p>
 - We can also reset passwords if needed from Active Directory Users and Computers.
</p> 
<p>- Same as before, The above images show how to reset passwords by scrolling through _EMPLOYEES and through Find. Let's reset a password</p>
<br />

<p>
 <img width="382" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-07 at 4 22 35‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c155ef9-d3ed-49c8-bcec-c5364e4a376d" />

</p>
<p>
 - Type in the new password under "New password:". Type it again under "Confirm password:". Click "OK" to reset the password.
</p>
<p>
 - Test the password reset by logging into the account.

</p>

<p>
 - Finally, before we end the project, log into Client-1 as jane_admin (mydomain.com\jane_admin) 
</p>
<p>
 - From the Start Menu, open up eventvwr.msc and click "Run as administrator".
</p>
<p>
 - The Event Viewer window will pop up.
</p>
<p>
 - Now we want to look at security logs. Expand Window Logs. 
</p>
<p>
 - Right-click Security -> click Find.
</p>
<p>
 -  Type in the username that was locked out earlier after too many incorrect sign in attempts (bal.lade).
<p>
 - Observe the logs and see the log in attempts the user made with timestamps.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This concludes the project. We added maby users to the domain and set up some Group Policy Objects. Don't forget to Stop (turn off) the VMs in Azure once you're done!
